# VaccinationMonitor

If you live in Berlin you might know how difficult it is to find an appointment to get a COVID-19 vaccination.

This app notifies you as soon as new appointments open up in one of the vaccination centers.
Click on the notification or the vaccination center's name in the menu to directly open the website where you can book your appointment.
